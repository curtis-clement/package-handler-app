Packaging App Reflection

What I Learned
- The basics and some "intermediate" useable of the C# syntax

- A lot about the C# typing system (mostly more basics)

- How to better implement Object Oriented Programming

- Using Guid as a way to generate id's in C#


What went well...
- I built the entire project using C# which before this project was a language I knew virtually nothing about

- The app works without bugs based on the testing and useage that I have done assuming the specifications that were given to me
and also taking into account things the app is lacking like validation and error handling

- The C# syntax fits my style of programing and I like that it is a bit more verbose but very clear about what you are wanting to do with it.
I felt that I was about to understand and implement what I have learned this far quite clearly.

- More strict OOP is not something that I have specifically worked with before however I felt that I did a decent job implement OOP.
This included separating concerns and also the idea of having classes and methods handle only what it needed and knowing only what it needed to know.
Also worked to keep files short and readable.

- I felt that I was able to achieve a really nice refactoring after my initial foray into C# and just getting the program to work and run.
I had to do a lot of testing and attempting to fix things to end at my final refactor. It took much longer than I would have liked, but I
felt that for my first time through with the language I did a good job with it.

- Was happy with how the code reads which I feel reflects naming conventions and standards that help the code to be accessible to anyone
looking at the code for the first time or the first time in a long time.


What could be improved...
- Implementation of OOP

- Better knowledge of C#/.Net design patterns and architecture standards

- How to work with reference types vs value types

- App needs validation and error handling

- Unit tests

- Keeping Main method / Program class clean

- Finding the solution to the issue of keeping all of the references to services in the highlest level of the architecture.
I am sure there is probably a solution for this -- ideally I would want to create something like a "store" in frontend terms instead of
having to use return statements to pass data back and forth. With more time and experience I am sure that I could find a solution that exists to this problem.

- Database connection and saving information. Obviously the basic applicaiton doesn't save any data or send any data anywhere.
This would be the logical next step and also something that I would want to spend more time on to understand and implement properly.

- A more robust frontend that actually uses a web browser or mobile app to process this information, provide authentication, valdiation,
show errors, and allow a user to view processed data etc.
